        <h1>YOUR NAME</h1>
      
        
        
        <p>In 2013, <em> Miyamizu</em> is a high school girl living in
            the rural town of Itomori, Japan. Bored of the town, 
            she wishes to be a Tokyo boy in her next life. One day,
            she inexplicably begins to switch bodies intermittently
            with <em>Taki Tachibana</em>, a high school boy in Tokyo.</p>

           <p> Thus, when they wake up as each other on some mornings,
            they must live through the other's respective activities
            and social interactions for the day. They learn they can 
            communicate with each other by leaving messages on paper,
            phones, and sometimes on each other's skin. Mitsuha (in Taki's body)
            sets Taki up on a date with coworker Miki Okudera,
            while Taki (in Mitsuha's body) causes Mitsuha to become popular
            at school. One day, Taki (in Mitsuha's body) accompanies 
            Mitsuha's grandmother Hitoha and younger sister Yotsuha to
            leave the ritual alcohol kuchikamizake, made by the sisters,
            as an offering at the Shinto shrine located on a mountaintop outside the town.
            It is believed to represent the body of the village guardian god ruling over
            human connections and time. Taki reads a note from Mitsuha about the comet 
            Tiamat, expected to pass nearest to Earth on the day of the autumn festival.
            The next day, Taki wakes up in his body and goes on a date with Miki, who 
            tells him she enjoyed the date but also that she can tell he is preoccupied
            with thoughts of someone else. Taki attempts to call Mitsuha on the phone
            but cannot reach her as the body-switching ends.</p>

        <p>Taki, Miki, and their friend Tsukasa travel to Gifu by train on 
            a trip to Hida in search of Mitsuha. However, Taki does not know
             the name of Itomori, relying on his sketches of the surrounding 
             landscape from memory.</p>

       <p> A restaurant owner in Takayama recognizes
        the town in the sketch, being from there. He takes Taki and his
         friends to the ruins of Itomori, which has been destroyed and 
         where 500 residents were killed when Tiamat unexpectedly
       fragmented as it passed by Earth three years earlier.
   Taki observes Mitsuha's messages disappear from his phone, and
    his memories of her begin to gradually fade, realizing the two were
     also separated by time, as he is in 2016.</p>

       <p> Taki finds Mitsuha's name in the record of fatalities. While Miki and Tsukasa return 
      to Tokyo, Taki journeys to the shrine, hoping to reconnect with
       Mitsuha and warn her about Tiamat. There, Taki drinks Mitsuha's
        kuchikamizake and then lapses into a vision, where he glimpses
         Mitsuha's past. He also recalls that he encountered Mitsuha on
          a train when she came to Tokyo the day before the event to 
          find him, though Taki did not recognize her as the body-switching
           was yet to occur in his timeframe. Before leaving the train in 
           embarrassment, Mitsuha had handed him her hair ribbon, which he
            has since worn on his wrist as a good-luck charm.</p>

            <p>Taki wakes up in Mitsuha's body at her house on the morning of the festival. Hitoha deduces what has happened and tells him the body-switching ability has been passed down in her family as caretakers of the shrine. Taki convinces Tessie and Sayaka, two of Mitsuha's friends, to get the townspeople to evacuate Itomori by disabling the electrical substation and broadcasting a false emergency alert. Taki heads to the shrine, realizing that Mitsuha must be in his body there, while Mitsuha wakes up in Taki's body. At sunset, the two sense each other's presence on the mountaintop but are separated due to contrasting timeframes and cannot see each other. When twilight falls,[note 1] they return to their own bodies and see each other in person. After Taki returns Mitsuha's ribbon, they attempt to write their names on each other's palms so that they will remember each other. However, before Mitsuha can write hers, twilight passes, and they revert to their respective timeframes. When the evacuation plan fails, Mitsuha has to convince her father, Toshiki, the mayor of Itomori, to evacuate everyone. Before doing so, Mitsuha notices her memories of Taki are fading away and discovers he wrote "I love you" on her hand instead of his own name. After Tiamat crashes, Taki, in his own timeframe, remembers nothing.</p>

             <p>Five years later, Taki, having graduated from university, is searching for a job. He senses he has lost something vital that he cannot identify, and feels inexplicable interest in the events surrounding Tiamat, now eight years in the past: Itomori was destroyed, but all of its people survived as they had evacuated just in time. Mitsuha has since moved to Tokyo. Sometime later, Taki and Mitsuha glimpse each other when their respective trains pass each other and are instantly drawn to seek one another, disembarking and racing to find the other, finally meeting at the stairs of Suga Shrine [ja]. Taki calls out to Mitsuha, saying that he feels he knows her, and she responds likewise. Having finally found what each had long searched for, they shed tears of happiness and simultaneously ask each other for their name.</p>
